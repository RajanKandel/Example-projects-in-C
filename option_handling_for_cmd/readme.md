# Convert temp into various scale using command line options
## Goal: learn option handling for command line

    -> Able to convert given fahrenheit temp to celcius and kelvin

# How to use?

- You can fork or download the repo, Once you have both the files "cvt_temp_opt_cmd.exe" and "cvt_temp_opt_cmd.c", You just need to run "cvt_temp_opt_cmd.exe"
-  To run type in command line : .\cvt_temp_opt_cmd.exe -t any_fahrenheit_temp -ck

# Future direction

- make it versatile to adopt to go from any temperature scale to other (for example from celcius scale to fahrenheit scale)
